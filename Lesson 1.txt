Git: Version Control
Git Hub: Collaboration

Difference between files: 
	a) Windows: FC <first file> <second file>
	b) Mac and linux: diff <first file> <second file> (displays '-' for lines missing in the 1st file and '+' for lines 	added in 2nd file)
	c) Git: git diff <1> <2>

Make one commint per one logical change.

git log 
git checkout <commit id>
git diff <commit id1> <commit id2>

In cmd/git bash to allow quick copy: Right click -> Properties -> Options -> Check enable Quick copy

Setting up workspace for Windows!!!!

Sublime text editor!!


Repository: All the files of the project. When you commit, 

Q1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Ans: Could easily loacte which line of code was changed.

Q2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans: Know what changes have been introduced and also not break anything which was working correctly earlier.

Q3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Ans: Pros
	a) You know when a major change has gone in and which is critical to be saved.
	b) Storage efficiency.
	c) All the versions are compilable and logical.
    Cons
	a) Might take the wrong judgement.
	b) External factors such as power cuts.

Q4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans: Because huge projects have many inter-related files

Q5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans: use git log command to view all the commits made to a file and the use the git diff command to view the changes made between 2 commit operations

Q6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Ans: I know I can revert back to a previous version which didn't have the bug and also know the changes which caused the bug.

Q7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Ans: For now i want to learn it and use it for the Android App and Website which i am going to build.
