Git can push and pull code to the GitHub. You push a branch, then all its reachable commits are sent. The ones that are already sent are not sent again.The new branch on github is also called by the same branch name.

On GitHub, create a new repository, copy the url and add the remote host to git.

git remote: shows all the remote hosts added

git remote add <name> <url>: adds that remote

git push <remote name> <branch> : push a branch to the remote

git pull <remote name> <branch> : pull a branch from the remote

Q1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: When I want to collaborate with others; when I want to share it with others (open source projects).

Q2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: This gives me control on what I want to share and what I don't want to and also not share before it is even ready to share.
